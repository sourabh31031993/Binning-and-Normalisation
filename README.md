# Binning-and-Normalisation

**Binning:** Binning is defined as the process of transforming the values into categorical values. The bin size depends on the data set we are using. In case of my implementation of binning I have set the bins to be “Auto” as the data set is large and it is difficult to determine the size of the bins. Below is the visualization of the binned data in the Histogram.  

**Normalization:** Normalization is a data preprocessing technique. There are many normalization is techniques like z-score, min-max normalization and decimal scaling. Among these I found out z-score method to be suitable for my dataset. Usually the type of normalization depends on the type of data that is fed.The results are displayed in the form of histogram.
